                On 19 February 1627, Shivaji Maharaj was born in a Maratha family at Shivnari Fort, Maharashtra. His steadfastness, bravery, and
                dominance served as examples for all who came after him. His courage knew no limits. He was a combatant who fought against injustice 
                to promote the welfare of the populace.

            <p>
                Shivaji Maharaj was regarded as a brave warrior who employed novel military strategies and was a skilled administrator. When he was 
              a child, he used to read the glorious stories of Mahabharata and Ramayana. He not only internalised the solid and robust traits of the 
              ideal Hindu's character but also adhered to their teachings from these two epics

                <h3>Legacy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h3>
                <p>Shivaji Maharaj was well known for his strong religious and warrior code of ethics and exemplary character. He
                  was
                  recognized as a national hero during the Indian Independence Movement. While some accounts of Shivaji Maharaj
                  state that
                  he was greatly influenced by the Brahmin guru Samarth Ramdas, others have said that Ramdas' role has been
                  overemphasised by later Brahmin commentators to enhance their position.</p>

              <h3>Life History of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h3>
        
              <p>
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha kingdom of India. The kingdom's security was entirely based on religious
            tolerance and the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus. Shivaji Maharaj who was the descendant of a line of prominent
            nobles was very brave and fought many wars to consolidate India. At that time, India was under the Muslim rulers and divided. The Mughals 
           were in north India and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur as well as of Golconda in the south of India.  </p>
        
           <P>The ancestral estates of Shivaji Maharajwere situated in the Deccan region in the realm of Bijapur sultans. He found the suppression 
            of the Muslim rulers and the persecution of all the Hindus in the region. He was sad due to the devastating condition of the Hindus that by 
            the age of 16 he convinced himself to be the cause of the Hindu’s freedom. It was a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his whole life.
           </P>
        
           <P>
            In pursuit of this conviction, Shivaji Maharaj embarked on a path of relentless struggle and strategic brilliance. He united the Maratha clans,
            employed guerrilla warfare tactics, and reclaimed many territories, establishing a strong and sovereign Maratha kingdom. His reign epitomized
            valor, religious tolerance, and social harmony, leaving an indelible mark on Indian history. Shivaji Maharaj's legacy endures as a beacon 
            courage, resilience, and the unwavering commitment to the welfare and freedom of his people.
